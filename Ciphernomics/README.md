### Summary
Game that uses an Affine Cipher.  Player is required to decode the word using the equation and key provided.  Player has 5 minutes each round to get the term.
### Instructions
You will be provided a word to decode based on a key.  The
game requires to complete each word in 5:00 minutes.  The key
equation will be provided and the variable x will be replaced by the number representing the alphabet.  % 26 represents the remainder after long division is complete. Once the equation is calculated you will find the number on the alphabet and that will be the letter of the decoded word.
### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Euclidâ€™s Extended Algorithm in Javascript
- Affine Cipher
- AJAX
- jQuery
- JSON
### Approach Taken
- Developed idea from Cicada 3301 challenge.  This challenge uses different variations of cryptography.
- Mapped out one Cipher to convert into javascript.
- Coded the initial Cipher into javascript.
- Built HTML and CSS framework while concurrently using jQuery to add elements to the DOM.
### Installation Instructions
Navigate to [here][1] and press start.
### Unsolved Mysteries/Problems
- None to my knowledge but could have added two player and additional Cipher types.
