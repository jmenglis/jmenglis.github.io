Game is based on decrypting a word based on Affine Cipher.  The user will receive a random word generated by the random word API located at [http://randomword.setgetgo.com/][1].  The word will be converted into the Cipher by using the formula ax+b % m, where:
- a = coprime number \< 26 
- x = alphabet position between 0 and 26, 
- b = a number of characters that you would like to shift less than or equal to 26.
- m = 26.

After the word is converted into a number it is then converted into a string based on the alphabet position between 0 to 26.

The user will be provided the alphabet position key and the formula to covert the word back to a real world.

The user will have only a set amount of time to complete the Cipher before a bomb explodes.

There will be 5 rounds with varying difficulties of length and time for decrypting the word.  Each round has a reset of the time clock and once the time expires the screen will shake as the bomb explodes.

Current designs include the left side of the screen being the space where the user enters their guess.  On the right side of the screen is the key and formula to deciphering the word.
